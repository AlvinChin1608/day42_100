# day42_100
I am currently engaged in a 100-day Python Bootcamp, which I am documenting and sharing my progress on GitHub. The boot camp is designed to progressively intensify, allowing me to deepen my understanding and proficiency in Python programming.

Additionally, I have chosen to include the beginner, intermediate and advanced in my documentation to provide a valuable reference for my future growth and development.

# What I Learned Today
Today, I expanded my knowledge on some fundamental HTML elements and concepts, which are crucial for building structured and visually appealing web pages. Hereâ€™s a summary of what I covered:

## Boilerplate
- HTML Boilerplate: I learned about the basic structure of an HTML document, known as the boilerplate. It includes essential elements like &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;, &lt;html&gt;, &lt;head&gt;, and &lt;body&gt;. This structure is the foundation for any HTML page, ensuring proper formatting and compatibility across different web browsers.
  
## List Elements
- Ordered Lists (&lt;ol&gt;): These are used to create numbered lists. Each item is wrapped in an &lt;li&gt; (list item) tag.
- Unordered Lists (&lt;ul&gt;): These create bulleted lists, also using the &lt;li&gt; tag for each item.
- Description Lists (&lt;dl&gt;): Useful for creating a list of terms and their descriptions, using &lt;dt&gt; (definition term) and &lt;dd&gt; (definition description) tags.
  
## Anchor Elements
- Anchor Elements (&lt;a&gt;): These are used to create hyperlinks. The href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to. Anchor elements are essential for navigation within a website or to external sites.

## Image Elements
- Image Elements (&lt;img&gt;): These are used to embed images in an HTML page. The src attribute specifies the path to the image, and the alt attribute provides alternative text for the image, which is important for accessibility and SEO.
